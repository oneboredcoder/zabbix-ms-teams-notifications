# Zabbix MS Teams Notifications

Script used to send notifications from Zabbix to Microsoft Teams using webhook

## To-Do
* make arguments optional and build payload based on what is provided,
* find a way to send graphs as images (might require change on MS Teams side),
* create insatallation and usage instruction
* probably a lot more...
